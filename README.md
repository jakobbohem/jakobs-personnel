# jakobs-personnel
-------------------
Sqlight driven register of people for quick lookup/filtering of personal details

# How-to
------------
1. Add the script path to you %USERPROFILE% PATH, by running `install.bat`, or `install.sh` on Mac OS.

2. You have to populate the database from data. 
Update `md_file_path` in `extract_data.py` and run it.
This will write all entries to `data/address_book.db`

(#TODO: pass the data file name to the update script)

3. the functionality of `lookup.py` and `analyze.py` has some requirements on python modules (such as matplotlib for plotting data) - to set up the local env requirements with pip run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Now call the Python script from your Python 3 exe e.g.
```
py lookup.py Name
```

# Notes:
to import address book data from a .md source file formatted as an md-table
run 
```
extract_data.py
```
after setting up the path to the .md source file to read from, by default, the script will look for source data in the `rawdata/` folder

some properties will require data in a `data/organisation_data.json` properties file. To update this file with appropriate .json data fields, run `bootstrap.py`



# Improvements

- [ ] Make the default search for whole words, but CASE insensitive, for easy access
- [ ] Search for multiword input (easy w/o quotes) on the command line
