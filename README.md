Sqlight driven register of people for quick lookup/filtering of personal details

# How-to
------------
1. Add the script path to you %USERPROFILE% PATH, by running `install.bat`, or `install.sh` on Mac OS.

2. You have to populate the database from data. 
Update `md_file_path` in `extract_data.py` and run it.
This will write all entries to `data/address_book.db`

(#TODO: pass the data file name to the update script)


3. Now call the Python script from your Python 3 exe e.g.
```
py lookup.py Name
```


# Improvements

- [ ] Make the default search for whole words, but CASE insensitive, for easy access
- [ ] Search for multiword input (easy w/o quotes) on the command line
